# Data

## subjects

The entirety of the dataset consists of 2605 animations with times ranging from 3 seconds to 3 minutes. Due to the size of the dataset, only metadata has been included. There are also plans to place features gathered from EDA.

## subjects_small
Notebooks are able to use this small subset of the data consisting of 3 animations. Currently, only the first 3 subjects have been included, see http://mocap.cs.cmu.edu/subjects.php for information on these subjects.

## sample_sets
Folder for storing sampled subsets of the data using the streamlit app. You do not need to access this folder, it only stores the data subsets for later in the _Modeling_ section of the streamlit app.
